# Energy provider: E-REDES

This directory will contain the tooling to convert data exported from E-REDES
into CSV files suitable for the generic import scripts used by Home Assistant.

* `ERedesDataPrepare.py` – conversion script (to be implemented).
* `Sample files/` – place sample `.xlsx` exports here for development.
* `tests/` – automated tests for the conversion script.
